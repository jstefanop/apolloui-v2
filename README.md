This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Apollo Web OS 2.0 

This web app runs the Apollo Full Node system and miner with solo mode functionality

It is designed to work with our pre-built ubuntu based OS system running on our aarch64 
controller, but should work out of the box with minimal changes for any aarch64 based debian 
linux system.
